## Browsing Objects
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=1

----

This guide is very out of date!

----

To brows all objects is quite easy. But some simple guide lines can be usefully for how to easier brows objects, how to order them and rerang them in what order you want to easier help you find what you want.

### Page browsing
![browsing](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/1_0.jpg)

This is quite self explained, on all browsing pages you will see this more or less, I don't think I need to say much about it, you can always find this to the top right or bottom right of each page.

### Simple character list
![list](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/1_1.jpg)

This one is used to help you brows objects by the first letter it will only sort them by the English letters so for now. # stands for all nummeric chars and objects who start with special chars such as []-_ and so on. Empty stands for english names titles who don't have anything inserted at all. The rest is quite self explained.

### Next is the Circle/Author/Parody/Content/Type/Convention/Publisher/Serie browsing
![browsing](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/1_2.jpg)

This looks more or less like this, first of the # Objects part is just showing how many objects there is under this category, the second part is the name also for most cases you can sort them by first letters here as well, there is no other way to sorth this ones.

### Browsing Objects
![browsing](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/1_3.jpg)

This is an example window of how browsing objects looks like, here is where most peopels seem to miss the functions of this doujinshi DB, and hence why this guide is writen. First of here you see the basic information about the objects, sadly at this date it's not possibel to customise the information here but may be able in the future. Secondly almost ALL of the different information types here is clickable, yeah you read that right, You can click Name, Jname, Pages, Type, Releasedate, language, 18+, Anthology, Score, Submitted, PV, Replies, yes all but Circle/Authors.
What happens if you click eg where it says "Releasedate" yes it meens they get sorted by the release date, always the oldest to the latest at start, but if you want to rerange them by Newest to the oldest you can do so as well, by clicking the same "Releasedate" again. By standard everything is sorted by the Name tag.
You can also click the image for evne more detailed view of the book, but that will be covered in another guide.

### Aditional data by browsing
![browsing](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/1_4.jpg)

This window you will always see as longs as your not browsing objects directly, it won't look exactly the same as the one at the top every time but will look somewhat like this. The one you see above is for Authors, as you can clearly read.
This window you can always see information about the ring/author.... and so on your browsing. In this example you can see that hte author POP is in the Circle Electromagnetic wave.
If browsing rings you can see what authors that ring contain, Conventions and such things you also see aditional information such as Date.
The HTTP is basiclay if an author is linked a homepage, by clicking the banner or URL listed you will get a new page and be linked to this one.
The Frequency tab is only for Circles, Authors, Content and Parodies. But with this you can selecth ow common something should show up in an object and order them by that rate, by default this is left blank hence not used.

This is basically everythign you need to know to use this page, if there is something you still don't understand you can always go and read or post questions at the forum.


## Content search tag
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=12

----
How to sue the content search tag: First of the seperator if for many terms is enter, so if you want to use more then 1 term hit enter and type in more. Secondly to search you need to specify WHAT you want to search and then the word. For searching content you want to type K:Swimsuit to search books with teh content of swimsuits. If you want to EXCLUDE a term you use example -K:Swimsuit you can also type +K:Swimsuit but it default to + if you don't specefy anything.

Other thing worth mention is that it ONLY select the first thing it find when you search. example +K:Swi will find Swimsuit, if there where more result or another result at first it will select it.

Here is the list of ALL search terms:
* C: Circle
* A: Author
* P: Parody
* H: Character
* N: Convention
* O: Collections
* K: Content
* G: Genre
* T: Type
* L: Publisher
* I: Imprint

Example of an search:
* C: Electro
* K: Swimsuit
* P: Moetan


## FAQ
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=3

----
**Q: What is a doujinshi?**

A: Doujinshi are self-published Japanese works, usually manga or novels. They are often the work of amateurs, though some professional artists participate as a way to publish material outside the regular industry. (S) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi)

## Image Search
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=21

----
<img align=left style="margin-right: 10px" src=https://www.doujinshi.org/pic1.png />

### Image search guide
To use the image search you upload an image, or an URL to an image, keep in mind that the size need to be max 5000x5000 and if your image is larger please resize it before uploading. You can resize it as little as 128x128 pixels.

You can take photos or scan your own covers of books to upload here.
Keep in mind that when you do that, you want to cut out the image enough so you ONLY see the cover and make sure it's line up as perfectly as you can.

You can see an example of how it should look like to the left of the text here of how an cover should look like after being edited.

Also this comes true when you want to search manga as well, do NOT upload the entire back/front cover you won't get any result at all!, You want to make the image look as much like the covers we keep on this site, yes that means JUST the front cover, and for manga having the spine is fine as well. This is very important to do this or you won't find anything, This apply to doujinshi as well, do not upload pictures with the front and back cover! only the FRONT cover.
There is also very little point of uploading pages within a book we do not store any of this info neither will we do that in the future.
<br />
<br />

### Using URL to link to the db from other sources

Okay from now on you can also use an URL to upload images from other sources to this site, it's very simple :) Point it to
http://www.mugimugi.org/IMGSERV/socket.php?URL=

and of course you need to submit an URL, example
http://www.doujinshi.org/IMGSERV/socket.php?URL=http://www.doujinshi.org/pic1.png

This is a new function so hope it will be used :)

## Quick Search bar (Plugin)
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=16

----
This is a tiny short guide on how to use the quick search effectively for this site, first of you can add it to your browser by just clicking where you select the search engine in your quickbar on any page on this site and add it, it's quite stright forward.

Asf or using it, it's simple, enter what you want to search and search..... Thought this will JUST search objects. To search example sircle fast you need to search for "c electro" to search for circles containing the word electro
Here is a complete list of every thing you can search for

* C: Circle
* A: Author
* P: Parody
* H: Character
* N: Convention
* O: Collections
* K: Content
* G: Genre
* L: Publisher
* I: Imprint

You can also use 'numbers', they come in order listed there, Imprint got NONE however so only I will work. Example to use an number instead of the letter.
"3 sakura" will search all parodies containing sakura, this is the same as "p sakura" the number you can use is in the order the in the list, circle =1, Publisher = 9

----
**Author**: dmwade, Thriff<br />
**Updated**: 2010-02-25<br />
**NOTE**: It is often better to leave fields blank or set to 'Unknown' if you are uncertain -- this makes information that needs to be corrected easier to identify.<br />


### STEP 1

#### EN TITLE
This should be the romanised title, and not a translated title. You can use the [Romanisation guide](https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=4) as a reference on how to get it right.
Some books provide a romanisation for Japanese text, but most do not. Also, some may give a title in English IN ADDITION to Japanese.
These are not romanised titles, so don't enter them here, instead used the [Alternative title](https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=5#alttitle) field in STEP 2 once you have added the book.
If you are unable to transliterate a Japanese title, leave this field blank, but be sure to enter the title in JP TITLE, so another user can complete it later.

#### JP TITLE *
Japanese title field, should be in either kanji or kana.
If the original title of the book is in romaji (alfabetical) you can set both EN and JP NAME to this value.

#### Pages
When applicable (not for most CG, software and "other" items), please try and fill this field. More specifics in the [Page Numbers](https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=8) guide.

#### Release Date
Define this field when possible. If you only know the year, or year/month, you may enter values as YYYY-00-00 or YYYY-MM-00.
Be careful, howevever, the value you enter will be ignored if it isn't in the proper format.
If the date is written in a 'strange' format in the book you might want to check the [Dates guide](https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=7).

#### ISBN
This field only applies to commerical books.
You may fill it if you wish (it exists mostly for people who may want to locate a copy of this book for purchase).

#### Type? *
Select the type of your addition from the dropdown list. (Default: Doujinshi/Manga)

#### Hentai Content?
Don't forget to set this to No when necessary. (Default: yes)

#### Anthology?
For books with many authors, set this to Yes. (Default: no)

#### Copybook?
A copybook is a cheap, selfprinted and often short book that is stapled in the binding. (Default: no) (see image for clarification)

#### Censoring
Level of censoring the book has.

#### Language
Wirtten language in the book.

#### Convention <sup>[1](#optional)</sup>
Only relevant for doujinshi items.
There are a few ways you can deduce the convention if you only know the release date:
* Dates falling into any of the "Comic Market" ranges are very likely to have been released at those events. Similarly if you know a book was released at 'Winter Comiket' (August) or 'Summer Comiket' (December) and you know the year, you can choose the appropriate Comic Market from the list.
* The above should apply to "Comic Revolution" date ranges as well. Comic Revolution is, unfortunately, no longer held, so anything post 2005/04/24 you'll have to figure out some other way.

#### Publisher <sup>[1](#optional)</sup>
Applies only to commercial items.

<a name="optional"> <sup>1</sup></a> The Convention and Publisher field will only appear when you view items for which they are applicable, regardless of whether you select anything other than the default.

#### Imprint
Applies only to commercial items.
Several publishers have brand names for their books, this is often printed on the binding and should not be put in the publisher field.

#### Collection
If the book in question has prequels or sequels it can be added to a collection. (These are mostly user defined.)

#### Info
Add here anything extra you would like mention about this item. This might include edition (re-print) info, details about the contents that you can't define elsewhere (pairings, etc), and so on. Please avoid adding useless information, eg. "This is a negima book, the cover is hot" -- instead, you could write "The girl on the cover is Yue Ayase".

### STEP 2
#### Images
* **Cover \*** <br />The cover image of the book, please check [this](https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=19) guide on how to best upload your cover.
* **Preview(s)** <br />2-4 pages from the book to use as previews.

#### Alt Title(s)
Any translated title that is not the original JP title goes here.

#### Add Circle *
Only relevant for doujinshi items.
A circle name is like a group/team name for people who draw doujinshi, it is often found printed somewhere on the cover or in the books info page.
If it can't be found or doesnt excist, set it to 'unknown'.

#### Add Author *
Name or penname of the author(s) of the book, can in most cases be found in the books info page.
If it can't be found or doesnt excist, set it to 'unknown'.

#### Add Parody *
What parody is the book based on.
For any manga or original work this should be set to 'Original'.
If it can't be found or doesnt excist, set it to 'unknown'.

#### Add Parody Character
What characters from above set parody are depicted in this book.

#### Add Content *
Any kind of content that is displayed in the book.
Set it to 'unknown' at the very least.

#### Add Genre
Applies only to manga items.


\* **Required field** (if any of these fields are left blank the probability of getting the addition/edit approved will be low.)

## Dates in Japan
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=7

----
Item date is often straightfoward. Find the date on the book and type it into the database in the convention of year-month-day. However, it is often not so easy. This article addresses those more difficult issues.

### VARIOUS EDITIONS

Commercial items and doujin items alike often have first, second, third and even more editions. Oftentimes, there are no differences between or among the various editions. In this case, I recommend using the date listed for the first edition. However, if there is a difference, which, for commercial manga, often consists of an updated cover image, then, edition becomes a point of interest. I've also noticed on a doujinshi, Blackdog's Aqua Necklace, that the second edition had a little less censorship than the first edition. Without comparing the various editions directly, it may be impossible to know if they differ, but I still recommend using the first edition's date unless you have reason to suspect a difference.

I have not considered, among commerical manga, if the different editions, especially those that change in some significant way such as cover, have different ISBN numbers. Also, I should consider cheaper repints of manga that often are released in smaller sized formats. For example, the Alice Blade commercial manga, by Ryuuen Rouga, listed in this database is a very small sized advanced edition. The first and maybe other early editions had a different cover printed on larger paper. I wonder if the two publications have different ISBN numbers. If I had the first edition of Alice Blade, I would document it seperately since it has a different cover. I've done such a documentation for one of Mercy Rabbit's mangas, which can be seen on this database.

### JAPANESE DATE CONVENTIONS

This pertains to the system of dating used by the Japanese for the years.
It is not uncommon to see the term Heisei (平成) with a number subsequent to it appearing in a japanese publicatin. This term refers to the era of the current Japanese Emperor. The previous period is called Shouwa (昭和) which spans from year 1926 to 1989. The Heisei peroid begain in the year 1989 and is still ongoing. Since Emperor Shouwa (Hirohito) died on 7 January 1989, thereby ending the Shouwa period, the year 1989, except for the first seven days, is a year of the Heisei period. It is also the first year and thereby termed Heisei1 (平成1). In turn, Heisei2 is the year 1990, Heisei3 is 1991 and Heisei16 is 2004.

Some doujinshi will appreviate Heisei with the letter H. Therefore, H2 is the year 1990, H16 is the year 2004, etc.


The present Gengo, "Heisei," meaning "Achieving Peace," was unveiled only six hours after the death of Hirohito. The new year, "Heisei 1," officially began at midnight, January 8. Therefore, 1989 is regarded as both Year "Showa 64" (the first 7 days) and Year "Heisei 1" (the rest of the year).
| Shouwa (昭和) | Heisei (平成) |
|-|-|
| Showa  1 = 1926 | Heisei  1 = 1989 |
| Showa  2 = 1927 | Heisei  2 = 1990 |
| Showa  3 = 1928 | Heisei  3 = 1991 |

| Showa 62 = 1987 |
| Showa 63 = 1988 |
| Showa 64 = 1989 |


### DATES EXPRESSED WITH JAPANESE NUMBERS

I noticed in some of Utatane Hiroyuki's commercial mangas that the publishing dates therein were listed using Japanese numbers. For example, I saw something like this: ä¸€ä¹ä¹äº” ä¸€ äºŒä¸ƒ

If the data submitter knows about the kanji for numbers, this should be no problem. It is a very simple substituion of the modified arabic numbers used in English writing for their corresponding Kanji. So the first term ä¸€ä¹ä¹äº” simply means 1995; the second, 1; the third, 27. Therefore the book was published on 27 January 1995.


### INCOMPLETE DATES OR REFERENCE TO A CONVENTION

Some books will not have the date printed on them explicitly. Some books may state simply the year and the month or month and the day. For missing data simply use zeros for the missing data and the correct values for the remainder. For example, suppose the book simply states 1999/8 thereby indicating that the year is 1999 and the month is August, the 8th month. Put 1999 for the year, 08 for the month, and 00 for the day. This, although, incomplete, is better than no data.

If a convention is mentioned by not a date, then find the date(s) of that convention and use that to complete the numbers for the date(s). For example, if the book states Comic Market 68 (i.e. C68, Comiket68) then, using the convention list, you can find that the date of that convention ranges between 2005-08-12 to 2005-08-14. The reason I used the term 'date(s)' is specifically in regard to Comic Market, the largest doujin convention in Japan that occurs bi-annually, which has occured over the last recent years over 3 days and, prior to that, 2 days. (I cannot say anything for the earliest years of comic market.) Suppose you know that the book was published in Comic Market 68 but nothing more, you can then enter the date as 2005-08-00 and enter the convention as Comic Market 68. A viewer can then understand that the book was released between the 12th and 14th of that month.

Some books have no clear indication of an publishing date whatsoever. For books like this and others that have incomplete or difficult to read dates, I strongly suggest using a Japanese search engine such as google.co.jp to try to find data on the book. Try searching the Japanese text for the title of the book along with the circle's name or the author's name(s). Try different combinations thereof and try to find the desired data. Sometimes, it is not possible, in which case the date must be left completely blank.

## How to upload Covers
Okay just want to have an general guideline on how to upload and submitt covers.
First of the basic, the webserver deals and resize covers, I recomend you upload them as large as you can and don't bother with resizing them on your own.

We ONLY want the front cover of books and mangas, for mangas we also want the book side if possible. DO NOT upload front/back or inner/front covers.

We also do not accept explict loli/shota art due legal reasons, "nude" picture in itself is not explict, if there is minor detail on the cover you can pixelate it yourself or else the entire cover need to be censored, I recomend to still upload the cover then censor it, so that the image search engine at least get the data of the cover.

example of a good cover is here:

![good](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/example_good.jpg)


And the flowing below here is 'BAD' examples'

## How to write a Guide
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=2

---
First of this is just a tiny help for those who want to get a kickstart about how to write guides, this gude does not really pick up the subject about how to 'WRITE' the guide just how to use the manager.


### First of to write a guide...
<img alt=Pic align=left style="margin-right:10px" src=https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/guide_01.jpg />

You need to select a category, and then a subject for this guide.
* General Guides = Guides about how to use the site
* Data Submiting Guieds = Guides about how to 'work' with the site
* Data Guides = How to enter the data and why and so on.
* Other Language Guides = Guides writen for other languages then english.
* Other Guides = Everything else goes here.

The name of the topic of the guide can be really whatever, try to name it somewhat so it's easy to see what type of guide it is.


### TYPING HELP:
<img alt=PIC align=left style="margin-right:10px" src=https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/guide_02.jpg />First of you got the big toolbar with a ton of settings, I won't really go true them but for most who ever writen in an text edior will find themself very home in this enviroment.

The only tip I can really come up with is that most shortcuts works here to, like CTRL + B for bold text, and yes even CTRL + S does work, this will basicly 'publish this object' but no worry you can go back and edit it again :)

Also another thing who may annoy peopels at first, so fast you press enter normally it creates the text as a 'new' section, if you want to just have an line break hold SHIFT and then click enter


### Uploading Files:
First off to upload files you need to insert an object, like the picture abow under Typing help you see an icon highligyed called Insert/Edit Image. If you click this you will get to a dialog, it will differ depending on what type of object your trying to insert.

![test](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/guide_03.jpg)

This image is when your trying to insert an image, notice the icon at the top right, if you click this you get to the filenamager, the filemanager is really self explained. And won't need any extra guides on about how you use it. Below is a picture on how it looks.

![test](https://www.doujinshi.org/uploaded/images/guide_04.jpg)


### Lastly:
This is bascically the entire idea about how to write guides and use this tool.
If your interested in writign a guide please go to the forum in tips/trix section and ask for bieng able to write guides, anad what guides you would like to write, they don't nessesarly need to be about this site, they can be about the Japanese language, how to buy doujinshis from japan and so fort. No guides is alowed to be about downloading files however.

This guide will be updated with more info when I get it.


## Katakana Field
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=22

---
From now on your able to use the katakana field for every possible object on this site and browse by it however most data does not contain Katakana information as of yet, this will however change.

The basic breakdown for the Katakana field is that it is used for sorting & browsing with the help of Katakana, mostly for the Japanese viewers.

Since this field is special it need a tiny bit more explonation.

First of this field only have a few valid characters, that is all KATAKANA  (no halfwidth chars!) and number digits 0-9. NO OTHER CHARACTERS AT ALL, Yes this include space.

Also stuff to not convert into it is stuff like Volume/Vol, date Kanjis and things like that.
Example of this is example COMIC パピポ 2007年06月号 should become コミックパピポ200706

### Definitions of Terms
* **DB**: Database. That is, this site, The Doujinshi & Manga Lexicon
* **object**: =Book. One of the data format on DB.
* **item**: =Circle, Author, Parody, Content, etc. One of the data format on DB.
* **own**: to hold ownership by paying a right countervalue
* **authorized**: to be consented, licensed or stated explicitly by the author him/herself, not by third party like resaller


### General
#### Removing/changing info
I accept newly added info if I can not prove negative.
But for removed or changed info, I require contributor to [prove that the former info must be removed or changed](https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1388).
Even if what you intend to change is Romanization of the title, I require you to prove the [superiority or validity of changing](https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1458#3848).


#### Policy of Style/Text formatting
Basically, I think that the [policy at ja.wikipedia.org](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:表記ガイド) is reasonable.
* When a character can be written in half-width and full-width, use half-width. (ABCabc012!"# and blank)
* But for katakana, use full-width. Do not use half-width katakana
> cf) [https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1376](https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1376).


#### Half-width katakana and other platform dependant characters
I think platform dependant characters should not be used.
representative examples:
* half-width katakana
* Roman numerals
* enclosed Alphanumerics
* heart mark


#### Duped pending object/item due to using back button of the browser
Using back button of the browser on Object/Items Contributions: Step 2 makes duplicated pending objects only when you add new object/item.
Use "Back to Step 1." link at upper right on Step 2.
> note) You can see that the edit ID is generated on URL once you move to page Step:2.


### Notation of the names
The notation of the names and its Romanizations on the book itself, author's website or web store are so inconsistent.
> ex) Tanuma Yuuichirou case on [https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1458&page=2#4146](https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1458&page=2#4146)

To prevent the confusion, I set a standard.
It is applied for authors, circles and characters.


#### Original Title
##### Spacing of Japanese writing
No space between family and own name.
> ex) [手塚治虫](https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/29589/)
> * ○: 手塚治虫
> * ×: 手塚 治虫

Source websites of auto import (Toranoana and Melonbooks) write without space and they work only in exact match so it is of practical use.


##### Spacing of alphabet writing
When the name, especially the name of the circle is written in alphabet, the spacing is often inconsistent.
> ex) [circle: SilverStone](https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/circle/3492/)<br />
> [book: SilverStone](https://www.doujinshi.org/book/735545/)<br />
> [book: Silver Stone](https://www.doujinshi.org/book/68497/)<br />
> You should confirm which is the most used one.
> And watch that you don't add duped item.
> Wildcard searching will help to prevent it.
> <br />https://www.doujinshi.org/search/item/?Q=s&T=circle&sn=Silver%25Stone<br />
>* _ (underscore) : a single character
>* % (percent sign) : zero or more characters


##### Capitalization
When the all name is written in alphabet, most of the authors capitalize intentionally.
> ex) [author: KEI](https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/4220/)<br />
> His name is always written as KEI, never Kei.


#### Romanized Title
##### Order of family and own name
Write family and own name in the same order as Original Title.
> ex) [手塚治虫 / Tezuka Osamu](https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/29589/)
> 手塚 (Tezuka, family name), 治虫 (Osamu, own name)
> * ○: Tezuka Osamu
> * ×: Osamu Tezuka

> ex) [チャーリーにしなか / Charlie Nishinaka](https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/1322/)
> <br />チャーリー (Charlie, own name), にしなか (Nishinaka, family name)
> * ○: Charlie Nishinaka
> * ×: Nishinaka Charlie


##### Method of Romanization, capitalization, spacing, hyphening
As you can see on Tanuma Yuuichirou case, Romanization which you see on particular one book might be used only on that book.
https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1458&page=2#4146
You must confirm the author ALWAYS Romanizes, capitalizes or spaces so or does on that particular case especially it is within the limits of standard notation.
ex) stemming froms within standard
おう: ô (circumflex), ō (macron), o, oh, oo, ou, o- (hyphening)
しゅ: shu, syu
っち: tchi, cchi
The Romanization is NOT within the limits of standard notation, it must be intentional one.
ex) 小林立 / Kobayashi Ritz
https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/5107/
ex) えのきづ / Enokids
https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/author/18523/


##### Correspond with Original Title
When the all name is written in alphabet, you must make capitalization and spacing correspond with Original Title.
ex) circle: SilverStone
Original Title is "SilverStone" so Romanized Title must also be "SilverStone", not "Silver Stone", "Silverstone" nor "SILVERSTONE".

### Object
#### General
##### How to add new object/item
object: https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1247
item: https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1453


##### Adding the latest books
I don't accept books before release.
The author might want to control the information at least until release.
The contributor must not own the book so the credibility is questionable.
Auto import can make duped object later. And it's hard that I make auto import not to add duped book.
So I recommend that you wait about a month after release if you don't own the book.


##### Blanks in required fields
You must not leave required fields empty.
Original title
Cover image
Circle (only for doujin objects)
Author
Parody
Content
If you can not fill Original title because Japanese is not your language, write so in NOTICE field.
If you can not upload cover image, write so in NOTICE field.
For Circle, Author, Parody and Content, set unknown at very least.
Unknown circle OR author is acceptable but unknown circle AND author is not.
When the author/circle that you intend to set is not added on DB, you can add them newly. https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1453


##### Only "unknown" in optional fields
Do not set only unknown for optional fields (Character and Genre)
Leave them empty when you have nothing to set.

#### Romanized title
##### Valid characters
I only accept ASCII printable characters for Romanized title field.
cf) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart
see also) Forbidden characters on https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=4


##### All Original title are ASCII but empty Romanized Title
When all of the title is written in ASCII characters, you should fill the same value into Romanized title field. Without doing it, the book won't be sorted by Romanized title.


##### Kana-transliterated English word
The word of English origin should be transliterated to original English word.
cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1052
So when the Original title is "イングリッシュ", Romanized title must be "English", not "Ingurisshu"


##### Official vs. Standardized Romanization
When the author writes Romanization on the book itself, I follow it.
cf) "SITO SYURAI" case on https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1458&page=2#4146


##### Translated title in Romanized Title
Romanized title is for transliterating, not for translating. If the translated title is authorized one, input it into alt name field in page STEP 2. https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=5


#### Original title
##### Authorized title only
As the title entered in Original title field and Alt names field, I accept only authorized title. So I accept the title only I can see on the cover image or sample images.
For example, I don't accept translated title by third party like resaller.
If it is difficult to upload the images which the alt title is printed, write where the alt title is printed on the book itself like back cover or colophon.
cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1227


#### KATAKANA
[Katakana Field](#katakana-field)


##### Other than Katakana in Katakana field
List of Katakana
* アイウエオァィゥェォヴ
* カキクケコガギグゲゴ
* サシスセソザジズゼゾ
* タチツテトダヂヅデド
* ナニヌネノ
* ハヒフヘホバビブベボパピプペポ
* マミムメモ
* ヤユヨャュョ
* ラリルレロ
* ワヰヱヲン
* ッー

There're some others but I think there's no case to use
<br />ヽヾヵヶヮ゛゜ and some more
Inputting blank is the most frequently seen improper edit.
<br />"・"(middle dot), "。"(Japanese period), "、"(Japanese comma) are not katakana.
Use half-width numeral, not full-width.
<br />"ー"(prolonged sound mark) is a kana. You can use it.


#### Hentai Content
##### Changing
Read http://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1270 before changing 18+ check.
In most cases, I check contributions without owning book. So It is hard to judge the validity of changing.


#### ISBN
##### Magazine
ISBN is not assigned to periodical. And first 3 digits of ISBN-13 are 978 as of now. 13 digits assigned to magazines are JAN. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number_(EAN)#Japanese_Article_Number


#### Language
##### Changing
If the book you read is translated, that doesn't mean the original one is distributed in translated language.
And this is not pirate site so you can't read whole contents by changing language or whatever you do.


#### Info
##### URL in Info field
You can edit external links from "Links: (Add/Edit)" on Book Info page after it's confirmed.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1442


#### Free Type
##### Inappropriate link
The point of Free Type is whether "AUTHORIZED PEOPLE" open to the public "ENTIRE CONTENTS" or not.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1233

If you want to link sample page like pixiv, you should add external links. https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1442
This is not pirate site so you can't read whole contents by changing Free Type or whatever you do.


#### Images
##### Unauthorized copy
Don't upload unauthorized copy images.
> cf) (5) of https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1295


##### Overwriting censored image to uncensored one
Major reasons of censoring the image are
The author requested to delete
The image could be illigal in a particular country or region
So don't overwrite censored images.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1308


##### Front and back cover
Isn't the cover image which you uploaded is the front and back cover, not the front cover?
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=19

Upload other than front cover as sample image.


##### Meaningless margin from online stores
Auto import of DB trims away the right and left margin of the images so I want the images to be trimmed.


##### Changing to image in different color
In most cases, the difference in the color of the cover means something like preview edition, reprint edition or convention/consignment edition. So I don't accept it unless you show undeniable grounds which prove the new image is the correct one.
> cf) top of https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=741


##### Re-upload the same image after confirming
Your image is already uploaded. If you don't see the images which you uploaded, that's because of cache of your browser or server of this DB. Try force reloading (ctrl + F5).


#### Alt names
##### Titles not seen on uploaded images
I accept only titles which are printed on the book itself to exclude unauthorized translated title.
So if you enter the title which is not printed on the cover image nor sample images, write where the alt name is printed in NOTICE field or upload the sample image which the alt name is printed on.


#### Circle
##### Other then distributing circle
I think the Circle is the responsible organization for distribution same as publisher of commercial manga.
It is usually printed at "発行:(name of the circle here)" on colophon.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1470


#### Parody
##### Setting specific title without removing "Unknown"
If the book refers to single parody, remove Unknown.
If it seems that there still are plural unknown parodies, remove Unknown then set Various.
Use Unknown when only one parody is left to be identified or you have no idea that the number of parodies left to be identified is singular or plural.


##### Setting specific title without removing "series"
Use "series" when you can not specify among series.
So when you specified the title, set specific title then remove "series".
You don't have to set both "series" and specific title.


##### Setting "ALL" to plural parodies
Default setting of TYPE of the parody is ALL. Change it as necessary.
If you mean the book is about crossover, set it to Genre.
https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/genre/24/


#### Character
##### Setting "unknown"
Character is optional entry.
If you can not identify the character, you don't have to set "unknown".
Leave it empty when you have nothing to set.


#### Genre
##### Setting "unknown"
Genre is optional entry.
If you can not classify the genre, you don't have to set "unknown".
Leave it empty when you have nothing to set.


### Item
#### Circle, Author - General
##### Editing suspicious/at potential risk of being combined author/circle
Auto import can not distinguish author/circle between ones whose names are the same. So when the value in source website is the same, auto import combine them as one item.
Only human users can separate when auto import combined them.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1554

And short names are tend to be overlapped. For the future distinguishing, you should add Extra name and external links in advance when the name is written in
* 4 or less kanas
* 2 or less kanjis
* 1 English word or common combination of English words like "honey bunny" or "gold rush"


##### Parentheses in Extra name field
Parentheses which surround whole Extra name on Item list or editiing page is displayed automatically without inputting in Extra name field.
If you input them, parentheses will displayed double.


#### Circle, Author - alias, inconsistent notaion
##### Combining same reading, different notations as one item
It's so common to be changed the notation of the name of the circle, author kana⇔alphabet⇔kanji in same reading.
So you have to confirm those different notations are aliases or not.
And for aliases, use linking.
> cf) Diffence between linking and alt names https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1438


##### Different name, not inconsistent spelling in alt name
For plural pen names, use linking, not alt name.
> cf) Diffence between linking and alt names https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1438

I accept only pen names which is credited on publications, not handle on the web, SNS.


#### Circle, Author - sharing same name
##### Adding new Author/Circle whose name is shared with others
You should add a distinguishing mark, that is Extra name field, to distinguish.
Beware that exist one is already combined with plural Author/Circle by auto importing.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1554

And short names are tend to be overlapped. For the future distinguishing, you should add Extra name and external links in advance when the name is written in
* 5 or less kanas
* 2 or less kanjis
* 1 English word or common combination of English words like "honey bunny" or "gold rush"


##### Extra name which does not help to distinguish
Extra name is for distinguishing between same names.

See examples below. Italic in parentheses are Extra names.
* circle: https://www.doujinshi.org/search/item/?Q=s&T=circle&sn=am&match=3
* author: https://www.doujinshi.org/search/item/?Q=s&T=author&sn=lisa&match=3
* character: https://www.doujinshi.org/search/item/?Q=s&T=character&sn=maria&match=3
> note) I try to input Extra name for all characters.


##### Activity, favorite motif in Extra name
Activity or favorite motif might narrows down a range but not uniquely identifies.
> ex) two こまs https://www.doujinshi.org/book/662945/ If their Extra name are "Pokemon artist", they don't help to identify.


#### Circle - member
##### Setting "unknown" as a member
Practical use of setting member is listing member author on editing page of object.
You should not set "unknown" as member.


#### Character
##### No linking to parody
You could link the character to parody only the first time when you added the character before moving to Item Contribution Step 2.
Don't forget to link this character with parody by editing parody after it's confirmed.


##### link with parody "series"
You shouldn't link characters to parody "series".
Because "List All Parody Characters" on the page Object Contributions: Step 2 list characters of direct superordinat parody.
For example, Misumi Nagisa a.k.a. Cure Black, very first PreCure, will listed from all latter titles if she is linked with PreCure series.
> ex) Misumi Nagisa → https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/character/667/


##### Erotic image
Upload as clean and non erotic picture of the characters as you can find.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1070


#### Collection
##### Adding new collection which can list easily by sorting.
Adding new collection makes pulldown menu on the page of object contribution step 1 longer.
I don't want new collection to be added when the series can list easily by sorting.


### External link
#### General
##### How to edit
https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1442


##### Deleting dead links
Do not delete dead links.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1478

> note) IMHO, dead or closed ones need some kind of discriminating sign.


##### Shortest URL to amazon
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=861

> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1429

> ex) Black Jack vol.1 by Tezuka Osamu http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4253031609


#### Author, Circle
##### URL of SNS as external link for author/circle
When the user name of SNS like pixiv or twitter is same or almost same as pen name of the author, add them as external link of the author, not circle.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1529

> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1544

You see links to private account of SNS are inappropriate if the circle which the author belongs is group circle like RPG Company 2.
> ex) https://www.doujinshi.org/browse/circle/1288/


##### Combined author/circle
[see 4-1-1](#editing-suspiciousat-potential-risk-of-being-combined-authorcircle)


##### Websites by third parties
The websites which should be added as external links are the websites which the author/circle themselves transmit, not the websites on which the third party refer the authors/circles.
> cf) https://www.doujinshi.org/forum/index.php?IIID=1529


## Page Numbers
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=8

---
Only items that are published with printed paper have pages. All of these items are printed in the book form such as commercial comics (whole and excerpt) and doujinshi have pages and therefore have a page number. Single paged items, while not always appropriate to consider as doujinshi, such as hand-drawn sketches, are still published on paper and therefore have a page number (most likely of 1 for front only paper and 2 if front and back contain writing).

CG collections of any type, shitajiki, clear files, posters, telephone cards (tereka) do not have pages. Therefore, no number should be entered for page number.

There are various ways to number the pages of a book and, while most methods arrive should arrive at a similar number, there are some methods to completely avoid.

### METHOD TO NUMBER THE PAGES OF DOUJINSHI

First, distinguish offset doujinshi from copy book doujinshi (cf. TYPE explaination article for details). Offset books usually have no printing on the inside and outside covers. They also may have some decorative filler pages between either covers, sometimes both, and are those pages which contain no drawings or writings. Some offset books do have content on the inside front of back covers, so it is always best to check against an original copy of the book or to pay especial attention to the enumeration within the book. Some doujinshi have color pages, especially near the front, that are blank on their backs. Such blank pages behind a full color page should be considered when numbering a doujinshi's pages.

Doujinshi often have a numbering system within the book whereby the page number is printed every page or some of the pages. The front cover is often considered as the first page and the inside front cover, although often blank, is considered the second page. The aformentiond 'decorative filler page', if it exists, is almost never enumerated. Often, the first interior page of the book is considered as page 3. From there on, the enumeration proceeds in the usual order of the natural numbers until reaching the end of the interior pages, an even number. Then, the inside back cover, usually blank, and the back cover are considered the final two pages.

Some books express their own internal numbering system differently. The usually encountered alternative is when the first interior page, viz. the first page subsequent to the inside front cover that contains drawing or writing, is considered as page 1. By the time the reader reaches the final interior page, the page immediatly preeceding the inside back cover, the question arises, 'should I consider the inside back cover and back cover as two extra pages?'. To avoid this question althougher, I dispense with the interal page enumeration and consider the front cover, inside front cover, inside back cover and back cover as consitituting four pages, similar to the method listed above.

Regarless of what system a data submitter wishes to use an offset doujinshi should almost always have an even number of pages.

Copy books can be a different matter altogether. Since they are printed cheaply on paper from a copy machine and held together with staples, it is possible for a copy book to have an odd number of pages. I've come across at least three different types of copy books. (1) pages are printed one one side of the page leaving a blank back side. Such books are easy to count. Simply count the front sides which contain the content and ignore the back sides. (2) two seperate pages of a book are printed on one side of a large piece of paper and then the paper is folded in half and the various papers are bound together. Such a book is similar to the offset publication however the inside back and inside front covers often have writings and therefore should be numbered. (3) pages are nicely printed and front cover and back covers exist with blank inside frond and inside back covers, however the book is bound cheaply with staples. I've only come across one such book, a resident evil parody, which happened to also have a color drawing cut out by hand and glued to the front cover, which consisted of rather thick black paper. I would recommend using the method for counting pages appropriate for the offset publication.


### METHOD TO COUNT PAGES IN A COMMERCIAL BOOK

Commercial works often differ from doujinshi in that they have a book-cover that is not glued or attached in any secure way to the binding of the book. This book-cover has five main parts (1) front cover (2) back cover (3) spine between front and back covers (4) flap that attches to front cover and folds between inside front cover and first interior page and (5) flap that attches to back cover and foldes between inside back cover and last interior page. This book-cover may be flattened out into one single sheet of paper and, if done as such, has printing on only one side and is blank on the other. This complex book-cover makes counting troublesome in the usual way listed for doujinshi. (Note, due to the irregular nature of doujinshi, there are doujinshi, such as Galaxist's Cham Is Oreno (ãƒãƒ£ãƒ isä¿ºã®) that has a similar book cover although the back of that cover is also illustrated with artwork.)

The book-cover itself wraps around another front cover, back cover, spine complex that binds the intrior pages usually with glue together. This secondary cover is similar to the only cover usually found on offset doujinshi. Once again, the question of how to number such a cover arises.

Commercial books also have an official page count that is listed on book selling websites such as amazon.co.jp. (Toranoana lists pages numbers as well for the comparitively few doujinshi that it does sell and may be used similarly. ) Rather than try to conflict with the official count, which is easy to find and corresponds to the internal numbering in the book, I use the numbering convention within the book as the guide to determine the total page count to enter into the database.


### WHAT TO AVOID

If you must reference a scan, rather than the original publication, check for missing pages. This can most easily be done by looking for the numbering convention used within a book and then, using that convention, counting foward or backward through the pages one-by-one. If you start on page 1 and then count four pages ahead, you should be on page 5. If the page says 6, then, most likely, you have an incomplete scan. Therefore, your data will be incomplete. Check your original book to see if you missed scanning a page (for your personal records), check online for data about the book (use google.co.jp and search the title, circle, author, etc.), or, even better, buy a copy of the actual book and check against that.


## Romanization
https://www.doujinshi.org/guide/?ID=4

---
**Author**: Thriff<br />
**Updated**: 2010-04-19<br />
**NOTE**: Work in progress...<br />

This guide is to be of use for correctly romanizing the JP TITLE to the EN TITLE field.
The system we strive to use for all romanizations is the Hepburn system.

---
### Kanji
If you're not fluent in japanese a translation application is needed, it is recommended that you at least have some understanding of the language to even try this. Any program that uses e-dict can successfully be used, webtranslator services are discouraged, even though some may use edict.
There are several good plugins for browsers to help translate kanji.


### Katakana
Since katakana is mostly used for transcribed words they can often easily be romanized and translated. Examples:
* KANA - ROMANIZATION - TRANSLATION
* コミック - komikku - Comic
* ブック - bukku - Book
* テレビ - terebi - Television

Either the romanization or translation of the word may be used.
However sometimes katakana is used as onomatopoeia, emphasis, names or technical terms. Such words can and should not be translated in the EN TITLE, only a rominization of it must be entered. Examples:
* KANA - ROMANIZATION - MEANING - TYPE
* ピンポン - pinpon - sound of doorbell - onomatopoeia
* スズキ - suzuki - Suzuki - name
* メガネ - megane - glasses - emphasis
* ゴミ - gomi - trash - emphasis
* フェイト - feito - Fate - name/transcription
* ヒト - hito - person - technical
* ドキドキ - dokidoki - sound of heartbeat - onomatopoeia

A table of all kana can be found on wikipedia: Katakana


### Hiragana
All hiragana should be easy to romanize for the EN TITLE field.
A table of all kana can be found on wikipedia: Hiragana


### Forbidden characters
These characters should NOT be in the EN TITLE field:
♪ × ・ ★ ～ ∀ ♯ ☆ ○ 。
They must be replaced with SPACE or similar looking ISO character.


### Abbreviations
Mostly found on magazines and if written in roman characters they can be used as is. Examples:
* ABBREVIATION - WORD
* VOL. - Volume
* No. - Number


### Dates/Numbers
Also mostly found on magazines, the kanji for year (年 - nen), month (月 - gatsu) and day (日 - ka). If all three are present with a date they can be removed to make it more conventional with / or -.
However, if they are 'part' of the title and not just a numbering, a romanization should be made instead. (The above mentioned romanization would probably apply.)


### Roman characters
Any title words or characters that are of the alfabet can be used as is and needs no change.
